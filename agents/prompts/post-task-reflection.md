# Post-Task Reflection

## Purpose

Help the user improve workflows by capturing friction points and proposing updates to the shared agent guide.

## Output Requirements

- Respond in the user's language.
- Be concise, specific, and actionable.
- Do not edit files; only suggest changes.

## What to Cover

**Friction points:**
- List 2–5 moments that felt slow, unclear, or repetitive.
- Include concrete examples (file paths, steps, commands) when possible.

**Feedback & improvements:**
- Suggest changes to workflow or instructions that would reduce the friction.
- Call out any missing information or ambiguities that caused back-and-forth.

**AGENTS.md suggestions:**
- Propose 1–3 edits to `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` (this repo reads it via that path).
- Include exact wording or bullet-level edits.
- Explain why each change helps.

## Optional

- If nothing meaningful to improve, say so clearly and explain why.
